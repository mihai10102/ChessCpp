This project can only be run using visual studio (the executables don't work).

This project has 3 functionalities:
	1. Play against computer (takes a couple of seconds for the opponent to make a move)
	2. Play against human (still takes a bit but not as long)
	3. Load game from file: loads the game from the game.pgn file located 
	   at ./Engine/ (has to be in standard pgn notation)
